    <h1>Why did the USA develop the atomic bomb?</h1>
      <p>The USA decided to start research and development of nuclear weapons after they got a letter from Albert Einstein telling the US that the Germans were testing and trying to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>Albert Einstein was not the one who found out about the Germans research though, for it was actually two other physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner who were in fear that Germany might be working on a bomb.</p>

    <h1>How big of an effect did the bomb have on the war?</h1>
      <p>Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, nine days after the first atomic bomb was dropped and six days after the second bomb was dropped. The bombs killed an estimated 129,000-226,000 people in Japan from both bombs combined, but they saved an estimated 250,000-500,000 US lives and millions of Japanese lives.</p>
  <br>
    <h1>What would have happened if the US never used the atomic bombs?</h1>
      <p>A high ranking Japanese official was asked what he thought would have happened if the US never dropped the bombs and tried to invade Japan, this was his response "We would have kept on fighting until all Japanese were killed, but we would not have been defeated." Even though the Japanese knew they would eventually be beaten they would not have given up until every last one of them was dead.</p>
  <br>
    <p>As Harry Truman said,</p>
      <blockquote>Using the atomic bomb was no 'great decision.' It was merely another powerful decision in the arsenal of righteousness. </blockquote>
