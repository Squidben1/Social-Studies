    <h1>Why did the USA develop the atomic bomb?</h1>
    <p>The USA decided to start research and development of nuclear weapons after they got a letter from Albert Einstein telling the US that the Germans were testing and trying to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
    <p>Albert Einstein was not the one who found out about the Germans research though, for it was actually two other physicists Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner who were in fear that Germany might be working on a bomb.</p>

    <h1>How big of an effect did the bomb have on the war?</h1>
    <p>Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, nine days after the first atomic bomb was dropped and six days after the second bomb was dropped. The bombs killed an estimated 129,000-226,000 people in Japan from both bombs combined, but they saved an estimated 250,000-500,000 US lives and millions of Japanese lives.</p>

    <blockquote>Using the atomic bomb was no 'great decision.' It was merely another powerful decision in the arsenal of righteousness</blockquote>
